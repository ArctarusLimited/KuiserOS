## ARNIX

This repository is intended to unify the common NixOS modules used for both Arctarus and my own machine configurations. The structure is inspired by [DevOS](https://github.com/divnix/devos), with a couple borrowed library functions.

Warning: Probably useful as a reference only! This contains some assumptions and defaults that you probably don't want, unless you are an Arctarus employee that is.
